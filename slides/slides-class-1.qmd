## Prepare

Before starting this class:

ðŸ“– Read the [Prerequisites](/prerequisites.html) page

Â 

#### Outline

::: nonincremental
-   R Basics

-   Data Frames

-   Transformation, Visualization, and Statistics
:::

## The RStudio Environment

Â 

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
**Four** window panes

-   Console

-   Source

-   Environment

-   Files
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
![](/images/rstudio-environment.png){width="645"}

## New Script File {#sec-new-script-file}

To create a new R script go to

**File** -\> **New File** -\> **R Script**

This should have opened a blank **Script** window called **Untitled.R**.

The **Script** window is a file where you are saving your code. This is where you will write, edit, delete, and re-write your code. Save your empty script somewhere on your computer.

## Running R Code {#sec-running-r-code}

::: nonincremental
1.  Typing code in an R script file and executing R code line-by-line `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter.`
2.  Typing code directly in the console window
:::

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

1 + 2
3 * 9
```

## Creating R Objects {#sec-creating-r-objects}

Â 

::: nonincremental
-   Objects are created using the assignment operator, `<-`.

-   Everything on the **left** hand side of the assignment operator `<-` is an **object**.

-   Everything on the **right** hand side of `<-` are **functions** or **values**.
:::

Go ahead and type the following two lines of code in your script file and execute the lines of code.

Â 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

my_first_object <- "hello"
my_first_object
```

Â 

::: nonincremental
-   You just assigned the value `"hello"` to an object named `my_first_object`.

-   Note that R is case sensitive

    ::: nonincremental
    -   `my_first_object` would be considered a different object as `my_First_object.`
    :::
:::

## Using Functions {#sec-using-functions}

Â 

::: nonincremental
-   Anything you do in R is by using functions.

-   Learning R is learning what functions are available and how to use them.

-   Example: there is a function to create a sequence of numbers, `seq()`.
:::

```{r}
#| collapse: false
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

seq(1, 100, by = 10)
```

# R Basics

## Objects and Functions in R

Â 

In R,

everything that exists is an object and everything you do to objects are functions. You can define an object using the assignment operator `<-`.
