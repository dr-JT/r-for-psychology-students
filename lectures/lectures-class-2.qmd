We will cover importing data, merging data frames, and restructuring data in this class.

## Pipe Operator

First, however, we need to talk about the pipe operator `|>` .

There are actually two pipe operators now. The original `dplyr` pipe operator, `%>%` , and the newer base R pipe operator, `|>` . You can use either one.

The pipe operator allows you to chain together a set of functions to conduct a sequence of manipulations on it. Conceptually, here’s what code written using the pipe operator looks like

```{r}
data |>
  step1 |>
  step2 |>
  step3
```

We start with our data. Then we do step1. Then we do step2. Then we do step3. The pipe ties it all together, enabling us to do multiple things to our data, all in one execution of code.

There are different approaches to writing code that performs multiple functions on the same object. Here is the standard, non-pipe operator way:

```{r}
# three steps: filter, calculate a mean, then select only some columns to keep
data_new <- filter(data, y != "c")
data_new <- mutate(data_new, x_mean = mean(x))
data_new <- select(data_new, y, x_mean)
```

An alternative is to use the pipe operator `|>`

```{r}
# three steps: filter, calculate a mean, then select only some columns to keep
data_new <- data |>
  filter(y != "c") |>
  mutate(x_mean = mean(x)) |>
  select(y, x_mean)
```

With the pipe operator, the result of the previous line gets passed (or piped) onto the next function. The first line in this example is simply specifying the data frame that is being passed from one line to the next. Notice how I did not have to specify `data` inside the `filter()`, `mutate()`, and `select()`, functions. This makes the code more concise and easier to read. The end result of the last function, then gets assigned to `data_new <-`.

## Import

R needs to know the full file path to the file on your computer in order to import it - this is what is referred to as an **absolute** file path. Absolute file paths start at the root directory of your computer and might look something like:

**On Macs**:

Users/username/projects/project_name/a_file.csv

**On Windows**:

C:\\username\\projects\\project_name\\a_file.csv

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What if you don't know the full **absolute** file path to your data?

I want to point out three approaches to specifying file paths in R:

1.  Use `setwd()`
2.  Use the RStudio Import Dataset GUI
3.  Use RProjects and `here()`

Never... ever... ever... use option 1, `setwd()`.

Instead, you should use RProjects and `here()`. But we will not cover this until Class 5. For now, we can just use the RStudio Import Dataset GUI to find the **absolute** file path.

### RStudio GUI

When you are having difficulty importing a file correctly or unsure of the file format the RStudio Import Dataset GUI can be really useful.

In the **Environment** window click on **"Import Dataset"**. You will see several options available, these options all rely on different packages. For now, select the **From Text (readr)...** option.

You will see a data import window open up that looks like this

![RStudio Import Dataset GUI](images/rstudioGUI-readr.png){fig-align="center"}

-   Select **Browse** on the top right and select the data file you want to import.

-   The **Data Preview** window will let you see if it is importing it in the right format. You can change the **Import Options** below.

-   Click on the 📋 icon above the **Code Preview** window to copy the code.

-   Click on **Cancel** to exit out of the Import GUI window

-   Paste the code into your **Untitled.R** script

    -   The most useful thing here will be the **absolute** file path.

## Exploring Your Data

When you want to just explore some data and don't care about creating a reproducible script it can be perfectly acceptable to not copy and paste the code from **Code Preview** window and just select the **Import** button.

### CSV Files

`csv` files are by far the easiest files to import into R and most software programs. For this reason, I suggest any time you want to save/output a data file to your computer, do it in `csv` format.

CSV stands for "Comma-Separated Values." It's a simple file format used to store data in a table. Each line in the file is a row of the table, and commas are used to separate columns. Think of it like a spreadsheet where each piece of information is lined up in rows and columns, but instead of seeing the grid like in Excel, each row is just a line of text with commas between the values that would go into different columns.

`csv` files are typically saved with **.csv** file extension (e.g., data file.csv)

To import a `csv` file you can use `read_csv()` from the `readr` package.

```{r}

library(readr)

data_import <- read_csv("filepath/datafile.csv")
```

### Tab-Delimited Files

`tab-delimited` files are a little more tedious to import just because they require specifying more arguments. Which means you have to memorize more to import `tab-delimited` files.

Tab-delimited files use **tabs** between items in a row to separate columns. In general, the delimiter is the type of value that is used between items in a row to separate columns. There are a lot of different types of delimiters with tab and comma (csv) being the most common.

Tab-delimited files are typically saved with the more standard **.txt** file extension (e.g., data file.txt) but a lot of other file formats might also have the **.txt** extension. This can create some ambiguity as to how the data is stored and formatted for .txt files.

To import a `tab-delimited` file you can use `read_delim()` from the `readr` package.

```{r}

data_import <- read_delim("filepath/datafile.txt", delim = "\t", 
                     escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
```

There are three additional arguments we have to specify: `delim`, `escape_double`, and `trim_ws`. The notation for `tab-delimted` files is `"\t"`. I always forget how to specify each of these arguments so I frequently use the RStudio Import Dataset GUI to copy the code needed to import a tab-delimited file.

## Merge

You might find yourself in a situation where you need to import multiple data files and merge them into a single data frame. There are two general classes of merging data

-   Bind

-   Join

### Bind

In R, a "bind" is combining data frames together by stacking either the rows or columns.

A row "bind" takes data frames that have the same columns but different rows and stacks them on top of each other. This will happen if you have separate data files for each subject from the same task. Each subject data file will have their unique rows but all subjects will have the same columns.

![Illustration of a row bind](images/row_bind.png){fig-align="left" width="677"}

A column "bind" takes data frames that have the same rows but different columns and stacks them side-by-side. This is a much less common situation than a row bind and can usually be accomplished with a **join** instead.

Row and column binds can be performed with `bind_rows()` and `bind_cols()` from the `dplyr` package

```{r}

library(dplyr)

data_merged <- bind_rows(data_1, data_2)
data_merged <- bind_cols(data_1, data_2)
```

### Join

In R, a "join" is merging data frames together that have at least one column in common with a mix of shared and unique entries in that column (e.g. Subject IDs).

There are lots of different kinds of joins, some of which are:

![Types of joins using dplyr](images/dplyr-joins.png){fig-align="left" width="405"}

For a full list and detailed description of the `_join()` functions see the [dplyr documentation](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#data-frames){target="_blank"}

But for the most part you can get away with just knowing how to do a full join using `full_join()` from the `dplyr` package.

```{r}

data_merged <- full_join(data_1, data_2, by = "Subject")
```

Whenever joining, you need to specify what are the **key** column(s) to join by - columns that are common between the data frames. Often times there is more than one **key** column that the data frames need to be joined by:

```{r}

data_merged <- full_join(data_1, data_2, by = c("Subject", "Session"))
```

## Restructure

The exact same data can be structured in different ways. There are two main formats that any data set can be structured as:

**Wide**: Variables are spread out across columns, making the data frame wider

| **Participant ID** | **Stress Level Score** | **Creativity Score** | **Memory Score** |
|--------------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| 1                  | 5                      | 7                    | 8                |
| 2                  | 3                      | 6                    | 7                |
| 3                  | 4                      | 8                    | 6                |

 

**Long**: Variables and values are spread across rows, making the data frame longer

| **Participant ID** | **Test Type** | **Score** |
|--------------------|---------------|-----------|
| 1                  | Stress Level  | 5         |
| 1                  | Creativity    | 7         |
| 1                  | Memory        | 8         |
| 2                  | Stress Level  | 3         |
| 2                  | Creativity    | 6         |
| 2                  | Memory        | 7         |
| 3                  | Stress Level  | 4         |
| 3                  | Creativity    | 8         |
| 3                  | Memory        | 6         |

 

And actually, you can have a **mix of wide and long** formatted data in a single data frame.

| **Participant ID** | **Session** | **Stress Level** | **Creativity** | **Memory** |
|--------------------|-------------|------------------|----------------|------------|
| 1                  | 1           | 5                | 7              | 8          |
| 1                  | 2           | 4                | 8              | 9          |
| 1                  | 3           | 3                | 9              | 10         |
| 2                  | 1           | 6                | 6              | 7          |
| 2                  | 2           | 5                | 7              | 8          |
| 2                  | 3           | 4                | 8              | 9          |
| 3                  | 1           | 4                | 8              | 6          |
| 3                  | 2           | 3                | 9              | 7          |
| 3                  | 3           | 2                | 10             | 8          |

Session is in long format with values stacked in rows. Stress, creativity, and memory are all in wide format.

A good rule of thumb for formatting data is to **have your variables (IVs and DVs) each have their own column**.

-   Notice that this is not the case in the **long** formatted data above. `Test Type` and `Score` are not variables in this study. Rather `Stress`, `Creativity`, and `Memory` are. Therefore, it makes more sense to have that data in a **wide** format.

-   This often results in:

    -   Measured variables in wide format

    -   Experimental conditions or repeated-measures in long format

-   Notice how `Session`, a within-subject variable, is in long format because `Session` is an independent variable in the study, so `Session` needs it's own column. `Stress`, `Creativity`, and `Memory` are other variables (probably dependent variables) in this study and so they need their own columns, therefore they are laid out in a wide format.

Restructuring data involves changing the structure from long-to-wide (wider) or wide-to-long (longer). The `tidyr` package provides useful functions to do this:

-   `pivot_wider()` "widens" data from long-to-wide

-   `pivot_longer()` "lengthens" data from wide-to-long

The `tidyr` package, like `readr` and `dplyr`, is from the **tidyverse** set of packages.

### Pivot Wider

Using the example data sets above, let's restructure the long data frame to a wide format:

First let's create the data frame - you can just copy and paste this code

```{r}
#| eval: true

data_long <- data.frame(
  ParticipantID = rep(1:3, each = 3),
  TestType = rep(c("Stress Level", "Creativity", "Memory"), times = 3),
  Score = c(5, 7, 8, 3, 6, 7, 4, 8, 6)
  )
```

The two main arguments to specify in `pivot_wider()` are

-   **names_from**: The column name that contains the variables to create new columns by (e.g. "Test Type"). The values in this column will become Column names in the wider data format.

-   **values_from**: The column name that contains the values (e.g. "Score").

Now we can use `pivot_wider()` to convert it to a wide format:

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true

library(tidyr)

data_wide <- data_long |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = TestType,
              values_from = Score)
```

::: callout-tip
## Column Names

R does not like column names to have spaces in them, but it does allow it.

Notice how in `data_wide` the column `Stress Level` contains a space. This is because the value in `data_long` had a space, which was not a problem then.

`clean_names()` from the `janitor` package provides a convenient way to get rid of spaces and replace them with an `_`

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(janitor)

data_wide_clean <- clean_names(data_wide, case = "parse")
```
:::

### Pivot Longer

The three main arguments to specify in `pivot_longer()` are:

-   **cols**: The column names that will be restructured to a longer format

-   **names_to**: The new column name that will contain values which correspond to the column names in the wide data

-   **values_to**: The new column name that will contain the actual values in the wide data

Using `pivot_longer()` we can restructure the data back to long format

```{r}
#| eval: true

data_long_again <- data_wide |>
  pivot_longer(cols = any_of(c("Stress Level", "Creativity", "Memory")),
               names_to = "TestType",
               values_to = "Score")
```

Check to make sure `data_long` and `data_long_again` are identical.

Okay, now let's say we have a wide data set with multiple sessions of `Stress` , `Creativity`, and `Memory`.

```{r}
#| eval: true

data_sessions_wide <- tibble(
  ParticipantID = 1:3,
  StressLevel_S1 = c(5, 6, 4),
  Creativity_S1 = c(7, 6, 8),
  Memory_S1 = c(8, 7, 6),
  StressLevel_S2 = c(4, 5, 3),
  Creativity_S2 = c(8, 7, 9),
  Memory_S2 = c(9, 8, 7),
  StressLevel_S3 = c(3, 4, 2),
  Creativity_S3 = c(9, 8, 10),
  Memory_S3 = c(10, 9, 8)
)
```

The data is not very useful in this format, so let's restructure it to be a mix of long and wide format. Using the rule of thumb above, we want to create 4 columns with `Session`, `Stress Level`, `Creativity`, and `Memory`. There are two strategies for doing this:

1.  Using `pivot_longer()`, `separate()`, and then `pivot_wider()`
2.  Use more complicated syntax in `pivot_longer()`

```{r}
#| eval: true

# 1. Using pivot_longer(), separate(), and then pivot_wider()
data_sessions_1 <- data_sessions_wide |>
  pivot_longer(cols = contains("_S"),
               names_to = "Session",
               values_to = "Score") |>
  separate(Session, into = c("Test", "Session")) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = Test,
              values_from = Score)

# 2. Use more complicated syntax in pivot_longer()
data_sessions_2 <- data_sessions_wide |>
  pivot_longer(cols = contains("_S"),
               names_to = c(".value", "Session"),
               names_pattern = "(.*)_(S\\d)")
```

You may find yourself in a situation where you need to select multiple columns in a argument but it can be tedious to type each every column, especially if the number of columns is larger.

There are what is known as tidy select functions to easily select column names, particularly if there is a consistent pattern to those column names.

This can be very useful in functions like `pivot_longer()`. In the examples provided on above, we used some tidy select functions: `any_of()` and `contains()`.

To learn more about what tidy select functions are available and what they do read the [tidy select documentation](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/dplyr_tidy_select.html){target="_blank"}.
