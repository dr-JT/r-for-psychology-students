Some examples:\n\nUnique IDs for each participant\nIf there are multiple trials or items adminstered, what column identifies the trial or item number?\n\nSame thing if there were multiple blocks or sessions adminstered\n\nDifferent experimental conditions or counterbalancing condition\nStimulus information (e.g., red square) for individual trials / items\nResponse information\n\nResponse made\nCorrect response (if there is one)\nAccuracy (if there is one)\nResponse time\n\nAdminstration date and time?\nAnd more…\n\nWhat kind of values do each of those columns contain?\n\nNumeric? Character strings?\n\n\nThe amount of time it took for you to do those steps is the reason we are doing this data preparation step. The end product will hopefully be a tidy raw data file that is way easier to understand and work with, even for someone that was not involved in the project.\nFor example you might have a data frame that is structured like this\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAre you able to understand what this data frame contains?\nThere is a bit of structure in the column names but that is about it.

    "text": "Data Cleaning\nThe data cleaning that you need to do will of course depend on the nature of your data and study. Give some thought to the type of data cleaning steps you might want to take. Think about what would identify an observation or participant as having low quality data.\n\nAttention Checks\nFor surveys, researchers will often include “attention checks” just to make sure participants are actually reading the questions and items and not just mindlessly responding. This would likely include removing data for an entire participant. In this scenario, you could:\n\nCreate a column, attention_check , using mutate() and case_when() that identifies whether an attention check item passed (coded as 0) or failed (coded as 1).\nCreate another column, attention_check_failures using mutate(.by = ID) (ID is the column containing participant IDs) to calculate a sum of attention_check per each participant.\nCome up with a criterion for how many attention checks a participant can fail and use that criterion with filter(attention_check_failures &lt;= criterion)\n\n\n# you can set this criterion in the setup section of the R script\n# you should come up with your own criterion though, I gave this no thought\nattention_check_criterion &lt;- 1\n\n# let's say item 4 is an attention check\n# and \"agree\" is the correct response if they were paying attention\ndata &lt;- import |&gt;\n  mutate(.by = ID,\n         attention_check = case_when(Item == 4 & Response == \"agree\" ~ 0,\n                                     Item == 4 & response != \"agree\" ~ 1,\n                                     .default = as.numeric(NA)),\n         attention_check_failures = sum(attention_check, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  filter(attention_check_failures &lt;= attention_check_criterion)\n\n\n\nMissing Data\nThere is a possibility that a participant has missing data. Maybe they did not answer all the questions on a survey. You can use a similar approach as with attention checks.\n\nCreate a column, missing , using mutate() , case_when() , and is.na() that identifies whether an item has missing data (coded as 1) or not (coded as 0).\nCreate another column, missing_total using mutate(.by = ID) (ID is the column containing participant IDs) to calculate a sum of missing per each participant.\nCome up with a criterion for how many missing items a participant can have and use that criterion with filter(missing_total &lt;= criterion)\n\n\n# you can set this criterion in the setup section of the R script\n# you should come up with your own criterion though, I gave this no thought\nmissing_criterion &lt;- .2\n\n# let's say item 4 is an attention check\n# and \"agree\" is the correct response if they were paying attention\ndata &lt;- import |&gt;\n  mutate(.by = ID,\n         missing = case_when(is.na(Item) ~ 1,\n                             !is.na(Item) ~ 0),\n         missing_total = sum(missing, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  filter(missing_total &lt;= missing_criterion)\n\n\n\nReaction Times\nFor behavioral and cognitive tasks that include measures of reaction time, researchers will often exclude trials that have unrealistically fast reaction times or extremely long reaction times.\nYou will notice that in the tidy raw data file created in Class 5 (see the data frame above), there are a few trials that contain unrealistically fast reaction times and extremely long reaction times.\nA common criterion for unrealistically fast reaction times is anything less than 200 milliseconds. For extremely long reaction times, we can just use 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds) as the criterion.\nThere are two general strategies to do this:\n\nuse filter() to get rid of the rows entirely\nuse mutate() and case_when() to set the reaction time and accuracy values to missing NA\n\n\nUsing filter\n\nCodeData Frame\n\n\n\n# set criterion in setup section of script\nrt_short_criterion &lt;- 200\nrt_long_criterion &lt;- 5000\n\ndata_scores &lt;- data_import |&gt;\n  filter(RT &gt;= rt_short_criterion, RT &lt;= rt_long_criterion)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet to missing\n\nCodeData Frame\n\n\n\n# set criterion in setup section of script\nrt_short_criterion &lt;- 200\nrt_long_criterion &lt;- 5000\n\ndata_scores &lt;- data_import |&gt;\n  mutate(RT = case_when(RT &lt; rt_short_criterion ~ NA,\n                        RT &gt; rt_long_criterion ~ NA,\n                        .default = RT),\n         Accuracy = case_when(is.na(RT) ~ NA,\n                              .default = Accuracy))"

    "section": "Viewing the Data",
    "text": "Viewing the Data\nLet’s first get to know this data, how it is structured, and what kind of values it stores. You can view a data frame by selecting it in the Environment window or by using the View() function.\n\nView(data_import)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDo you think View() should be included in the R script or just typed directly into the Console?\n\n\nBy viewing the data we can see that there are columns that contain information such as the species of the penguin, the island it belongs to, some size dimensions, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNotice how the column names are simple but also convey useful information for someone to easily understand this data. For instance, the the column bill_length_mm is not only straightforward but conveys the unit of measurement. It is not always possible to create both concise and information rich column names like these. When that is the case you can go on the side of being concise while providing documentation elsewhere that provides more detail.\nThis principle of easy to understand is important and something we will keep coming back to.\n\n\nThis data frame has a small number of columns so they are all easy to see. However, some data sets you work with will have a lot more columns that are difficult to view on a single page. In those cases, it can be useful to get a list of the column names printed to the Console. This can be done using the colnames() function.\n\ncolnames(data_import)\n\nDoing so also allows you to copy and paste the column names from the console into your R script. This is a good strategy to avoid typos that can cause you headaches when writing R code.\nIt is important to understand what are the values and types of values stored in each column of your data. To get an initial peak at the data, you can use the head() function.\n\nhead(data_import)\n\nYou can only see the first 10 rows, but you can already see some useful information. For instance, the type of values are noted in gray below the column names between &lt; &gt;. We will discuss these in more detail soon, but notice that the column year is of type &lt;int&gt; meaning integer. Integers are simple numbers with no decimal places.\nYou may also notice that some columns contain NA values. These are missing values and are important to know if you have any in your data.\nTo get more information as to the values in each column you can use the unique() function along with a $ notation. $ is a notation to reference a certain column in a data frame. For example, to reference the species column in data_import you would specify data_import$species. unique() will get the unique set of values in a column of data. This is useful to evaluate what values are contained in a column.\n\nunique(data_import$species)\n\nIt looks like there are three unique values in the species column, Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap. The species column is a type or class of values that are known as factors, again more on this in a bit. You could see this when we used head() with the notation &lt;fct&gt; meaning factor. But you can also see this because unique() also displayed the levels of the factor. Levels mean that there is a specified order to the values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhat are the unique values in the year column? Does this column seem like it is a factor? What about sex?"

    "text": "Factors\nNotice that if you evaluate the type of values in species you get an “integer”. This is probably surprising to you because 1) They look like character values (non-numeric), and 2) I told you earlier that the species column is a factor. Factors are a special type of column, that represent levels of a category with an order to those levels. The actual values in Factors can be of type character, double, integer, or logical. However, they are represented as integers corresponding to the order of the levels. Factors become especially important in data visualization and statistical analysis.\nYou can set a column of values as a factor by using factor()\n\nfactor(data_import$year, levels = c(2007, 2008, 2009))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that this line of code does not actually change the values in data_import (neither did the as.character(data_import$bill_depth_mm) line of code above). Don’t believe me? Run unique(data_import$year) or head(data_import).\nWhy do you think this is the case?\nIt is because we did not use the assignment operator. We simply printed the result of this function to the Console. In order to actually change the values in a data frame you need to assign &lt;- the result of the function factor() to a column in the data frame. In this case, to the values in the column species in the data_import object, data_import$species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHow did I know how to use the argument name levels = in factor()? You can learn about arguments a function can take, and what they do using the helper function ?. For instance type ?factor() in the console. In the Help window, you can see there are a number of arguments that can be specified in factor(). For levels, it states that it is an optional vector of the unique values that x might have taken. This tells us we need to supply a vector of unique values. You can use the c() function to create a vector of values. Type c(2007, 2008, 2009) in the Console. You can see there are three elements in the vector for each year. We specify this vector in the levels argument to tell factor() that these are the unique values in the data_import$year column."

    "text": "For this activity we will work with a real data set from a paper published in Psychological Science (one of the leading journals in psychology).\n📄 Download the paper (optional)\n⬇️ Download the data\nIn this research, Dawtry, Sutton, and Sibley (2015) wanted to examine why people differ in their assessments of the increasing wealth inequality within developed nations. Previous research reveals that most people desire a society in which the overall level of wealth is high and that wealth is spread somewhat equally across society. However, support for this approach to income distribution changes across the social strata. In particular, wealthy people tend to view society as already wealthy and thus are satisfied with the status quo, and less likely to support redistribution. In their paper Dawtry et al., (2015) sought to examine why this is the case. The authors propose that one reason wealthy people tend to view the current system is fair is because their social-circle is comprised of other wealthy people, which biases their perceptions of wealth, which leads them to overestimate the mean level of wealth across society.\nTo test this hypothesis, the authors conducted a study with 305 participants, recruited from an online participant pool. Participants reported their own annual household income, the income level of those within their own social circle, and the income for the entire population. Participants also rated their perception of the level of equality/inequality across their social circle and across society, their level of satisfaction with and perceived fairness of the current system, their attitudes toward redistribution of wealth (measured using a four-item scale), and their political preference.\nKey variables we will look at:"

Notion is a program I personally use and recommend, but a simple folder on your desktop with R scripts is also a viable option.\nWithout a central location for frequently used code, you may find yourself spending a significant amount of time and effort searching through previous projects to locate the code you need.

(this is not the case with our example data because I am keeping it simple)\nAnother major problem with the messy raw data from Qualtrics is that everything is spread across columns (wide format). When that is the case, we cannot visually group certain columns together making it challenging to understand which questions/items go together.

    "text": "According to the R website\n\nR is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.\n\nLet’s unpack this a bit.\n\nFree is nice!\nStatistical computing is a general term referring to a large class of techniques that involves statistics, machine learning, and more.\nGraphics refers to creating visualizations of data and output from statistical computing.\n\nIt’s really all about data! We live in a data rich world. Our personal lives, the media, and the workplace are inundated with data. But data is often times obscure and not intuitive compared to how we interact with real-world objects. It is hidden behind numbers stored in columns, rows, and complex databases. There are also more units of data that we can realistically process and understand. As a result, data can easily be misleading and at worse be used to intentionally deceive and lie (see How to Lie with Statistics).\nA fundamental skill for the modern person, therefore, is to have some level of competency with working with and understanding data. Where it comes from, how it can be transformed, basic concepts about statistics and probability, and the graphical visualization of data.\nSo where does R come in?\nR is only one of many tools that are available to learn about data, process it, understand it with statistics, and visualize it for the purpose of communication and understanding.\nR is a coding language. There are pros and cons to this. Any coding language requires a steep learning curve but the underlying logic of most coding languages is the same, and therefore; it can introduce you to a world coding that allows a powerful level of control and customization that goes beyond what we can achieve through the more clunky interface of real-world objects and graphical user interfaces (GUI) on our monitors.\nDebates on which programming language you should learn and use are rampant on the internet and social media. For the basic undergraduate psychology student, R has a lot of advantages. Beyond that one may want to learn Python, Julia, or Matlab.\nRegardless of which programming language you learn, working with data through code provides a challenge that will open you up to the world of data. You will gain an appreciation for the level of mundanity and complexity that is involved in processing the vast amounts of data in this world. Through working with data yourself, you will also become a better consumer of data and information that you see in your own work, the news, and social media.\nIt all starts with gaining a basic level of proficiency in 1) working with data, 2) data visualization, and 3) statistical computation. This course will cover the basics in each of these areas using R and from there you should be equipped to continue learning more on your own and from other courses.",

    "text": "Getting to Know RStudio\nWhile R is the actual programming software that executes the code, RStudio is an environment for interacting with R, writing R scripts, managing and organizing projects, and much more. When you open RStudio, it will open a window to the R console within the RStudio environment.\nGo ahead an open the RStudio application on your computer.\nWhen you open a fresh session of RStudio there are 3 window panes open. The Console window, the Environment window, and the Files window. Go ahead and navigate to File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Script. You should now see something similar to the image below\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: RStudio window panes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 4 window panes and each one has it’s own set of tabs associated with it:\n\nThe Console window (the bottom left window pane) is where code is executed and output is displayed.\nThe Source window (the top left window pane) is where you will write your code to create a script file. When you open a new script file you will see a blank sheet where you can start writing the script. When you execute lines of code from here you will see it being executed in the Console window.\nThe Source window is also where you can view data frames you have just imported or created. In the image above, notice the different tabs in the Source window. There are two “Untitled” script files open and one data frame called ‘data’.\nThe Environment window (top right window pane) is where you can see any data frames, variables, or functions you have created. Go ahead and type the following in your Console window and hit enter.\n\n\nwelcome_message &lt;- \"hello\"\n\nYou should now see the variable welcome_message in the Environment window pane\n\nThe Files window (the bottom right window pane) is where you can see your computer’s directories, plots you create, manage packages, and see help documentation.\n\nYou can also Customize RStudio settings and appearances.\n\nCustomizing RStudio\nComing soon…",

    "text": "Regression\nThe regression method requires multiple regression models because we have two dependent variables in the mode - the mediation and the outcome measure. The mediator acts as both an independent variable and dependent variable in the model. Because regression requires only one dependent variable, we cannot test the full model in one regression model. Instead, we have to test the different pieces of the model one at a time. We also need to perform a test on the indirect effect itself, which will require a separate model.\nIn order to evaluate the standardize coefficients (which is often times most useful), we need to first convert the the variables into z-scores. This is fairly straightforward but does require some extra code. A z-score is standardized score on the scale of standard deviation units and is calculated as:\nz-score = (raw score - mean) / sd\nWe can create new columns representing the z-scores using mutate() from the dplyr package.\n\ndata_mediation &lt;- happiness_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(Happiness_z = \n           (Happiness - mean(Happiness)) / sd(Happiness),\n         Social_Support_z = \n           (Social_Support - mean(Social_Support)) / sd(Social_Support),\n         Emotion_Regulation_z = \n           (Emotion_Regulation - mean(Emotion_Regulation)) / sd(Emotion_Regulation))\n\nThe standard regression model typically involves three regression models and a model testing the indirect effect.\n\nA model with the total effect: dv ~ iv\n\n\nreg_total &lt;- lm(Happiness_z ~ Social_Support_z, \n                data = data_mediation)\n\n\nA model with the effect of the predictor on the mediator: m ~ iv\n\n\nreg_med &lt;- lm(Emotion_Regulation_z ~ Social_Support_z, \n              data = data_mediation)\n\n\nA model with the direct effect and the effect of the mediator: dv ~ iv + m\n\n\nreg_direct &lt;- lm(Happiness_z ~ Emotion_Regulation_z + Social_Support_z, \n                 data = data_mediation)\n\n\nA statistical test of the indirect effect: mediation::mediate()\n\n\nmodel_mediation &lt;- mediation::mediate(reg_med, reg_direct,\n                                      treat = \"Social_Support_z\",\n                                      mediator = \"Emotion_Regulation_z\",\n                                      boot = TRUE, sims = 1000, \n                                      boot.ci.type = \"bca\")\n\n\neasystatsmodeloutput\n\n\n\n1.

    "text": "CSV Files\ncsv files are by far the easiest files to import into R and most software programs. For this reason, I suggest any time you want to save/output a data file to your computer, do it in csv format.\nCSV stands for “Comma-Separated Values.” It’s a simple file format used to store data in a table. Each line in the file is a row of the table, and commas are used to separate columns. Think of it like a spreadsheet where each piece of information is lined up in rows and columns, but instead of seeing the grid like in Excel, each row is just a line of text with commas between the values that would go into different columns.\ncsv files are typically saved with .csv file extension (e.g., data file.csv)\nTo import a csv file you can use read_csv() from the readr package.\n\nlibrary(readr)\n\ndata_import &lt;- read_csv(\"filepath/datafile.csv\")"

    "text": "Tab-Delimited Files\ntab-delimited files are a little more tedious to import just because they require specifying more arguments. Which means you have to memorize more to import tab-delimited files.\nTab-delimited files use tabs between items in a row to separate columns. In general, the delimiter is the type of value that is used between items in a row to separate columns. There are a lot of different types of delimiters with tab and comma (csv) being the most common.\nTab-delimited files are typically saved with the more standard .txt file extension (e.g., data file.txt) but a lot of other file formats might also have the .txt extension. This can create some ambiguity as to how the data is stored and formatted for .txt files.\nTo import a tab-delimited file you can use read_delim() from the readr package.\n\ndata_import &lt;- read_delim(\"filepath/datafile.txt\", delim = \"\\t\", \n                     escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)\n\nThere are three additional arguments we have to specify: delim, escape_double, and trim_ws. The notation for tab-delimted files is \"\\t\". I always forget how to specify each of these arguments so I frequently use the RStudio Import Dataset GUI to copy the code needed to import a tab-delimited file."

    "text": "Up to this point we have not had to give much thought to project organization and reproducibility because you have mainly been working with a single R script and importing one or two data files. However, working on a research project often involves a larger set of R scripts, multiple data files, and a report containing data visualizations and statistical analyses.\nProject organization is often overlooked at the expense of “just getting it done” because it takes more time and forethought to organize a project. However, the “just getting it done” approach can lead to a lot of unintended consequences:\nThe thing is, simply using R does not get around any of this. In fact, sometimes it can exacerbate it because of the extra cognitive demand faced when writing code. This extra demand can make the “just getting it done” approach more tempting. So what is the solution?\nThe solution is to slow down and give some thought to the organization of your project and it’s reproducibility."

    "text": "What does reproducibility mean?\nReproducibility means that all data processing and analysis steps can be fully reproduced using only the original raw data files and the execution of the R scripts. There are different levels of reproducibility (I made these up):\n\nPartially reproducible - only some data processing and analysis steps can be reproduced, which may be due to a lack of original raw data files, the “just get it done” approach, or the use of proprietary and non-reproducible software.\nMinimally reproducible (acceptable) - all data processing and analysis steps can be reproduced on any research team members computer without any modifications needed.\nModerately reproducible (desired) - meets the minimal level plus other people not involved in the research project can reproduce the steps with minimal modifications.\nHighly reproducible (good luck!) - fully reproducible without major modifications needed by people not involved in the research project 5 - 10+ years from now.\n\nA minimal level of reproducibility is still acceptable, as achieving more requires significant time and effort. We should strive for a moderate amount of reproducibility but achieving it requires more than just writing code. Your code must be organized, easy to understand, and include notes and documentation. Even if you or someone else attempts to reproduce your steps in the future, they can modify the code to make it work. The highest level of reproducibility is difficult to achieve due to software and code updates. Your code may only work with the current version of R or other packages. There are solutions to this problem of software and code updates, but who knows if those will work in the future!\n\nSimply using R for data analysis does not guarantee that your workflow is reproducible. In fact, there are many non-reproducible ways to use R. To ensure at least a moderate level of reproducibility, consider the following criteria (this is not an exhaustive list):\n\nYour statistical analysis (the final step) can be fully reproduced from the raw data files and your R scripts\nYour code can be reproduced on other computers without any modifications\nYour data and R scripts are organized and documented in a way that makes them easily understandable\n\nThis last criterion is extremely important, but is often overlooked. If others cannot understand your workflow, then it is not moderately reproducible. Therefore, it is important to take the time and think about the organization of your project, files, data, and scripts."

A relative file path can be used on different computers as long as the internal organization of folders and files for the project are the same.\nHowever, at some point your computer does need to know the absolute file path to your project folder.
